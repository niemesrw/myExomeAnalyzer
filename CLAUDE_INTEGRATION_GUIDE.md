## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "No tools available" Error
```bash
# Check MCP server status
npm run mcp-server

# Verify configuration path in Claude Desktop
# Ensure absolute path is correct in config
```

#### 2. Slow Query Performance
```markdown
Query: "Why are my searches taking a long time?"

Claude: Let me check the database performance and suggest optimizations.

[Runs performance diagnostics]

Performance Analysis:
- Array size: 7.2 GB (normal)
- Index status: Optimized
- Memory usage: Within limits

Suggestions:
1. Use smaller genomic regions for initial searches
2. Add specific filters to reduce result sets
3. Consider chromosome-specific queries for better performance
```

#### 3. Missing Data Warnings
```markdown
Query: "Some variants seem to be missing frequency data"

Claude: I'll investigate the data completeness for population frequencies.

[Checks population frequency coverage]

Data Coverage Analysis:
‚úÖ Chromosome 17: Complete gnomAD coverage
‚úÖ Chromosome 22: Complete gnomAD coverage  
‚úÖ Chromosome 13: Complete gnomAD coverage
‚ö†Ô∏è  Other chromosomes: gnomAD data not yet processed

Recommendation: Process additional chromosomes if genome-wide frequency data is needed.
```

- Large gene region analyses
- Comprehensive clinical reports

## Best Practices

### 1. Query Optimization
```markdown
‚ùå Avoid: "Show me all variants in the genome"
‚úÖ Better: "Find variants in chromosome 17 between 41M-42M"
‚úÖ Best: "Find pathogenic variants in BRCA1 gene region"
```

### 2. Clinical Context
```markdown
‚ùå Generic: "What variants are here?"
‚úÖ Specific: "Identify cancer risk variants in BRCA genes"
‚úÖ Clinical: "Assess hereditary cancer risk based on these variants"
```

### 3. Multi-step Analysis
```markdown
‚úÖ Structured approach:
1. "First, give me an overview of the dataset"
2. "Then search for variants in cancer genes"  
3. "Finally, analyze clinical significance"
```

## Future Enhancements
