## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Testing Notes**

### **Helix Exome Quality Filtering**
Your data uses Helix's commercial exome pipeline with specific quality filters:
- **PASS**: Highest quality variants (rare but most reliable)
- **BOOSTED**: Quality-boosted variants (high confidence) 
- **IMP**: Imputed variants (moderate confidence, statistically inferred)
- **LOWQ**: Low quality variants (not suitable for clinical decisions)

**Recommended for clinical analysis**: Include PASS, BOOSTED, and IMP variants while excluding LOWQ.

### **Always Include Clinical Context**
For any health-related queries, include:
- "For research and educational purposes only"
- "This analysis requires clinical validation"
- "Consult genetic counselor for health decisions"

### **Professional Query Example**
```
"For research purposes only: Analyze BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants in my genomic data with population frequency context. This is educational analysis and not for clinical decision-making - any health-related findings would require validation by certified clinical laboratories and genetic counseling."
```

## üöÄ **Getting Started Recommendations**

### **Start With These 5 Prompts:**
